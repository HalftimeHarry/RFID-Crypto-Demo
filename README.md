# RFID-Crypto-Demo

This demo showcases how an RFID card reader can be used to trigger a cryptocurrency transaction on the blockchain. When a contactless transaction is detected from the RFID fob, a message is sent to the blockchain to transfer cryptocurrency to the user's wallet. The demo is built using Svelte and Web3.js, and is hosted on IPFS.

Getting Started
To get started with this demo, you will need an RFID card reader and fob, as well as a wallet with some cryptocurrency. You can use a test network, such as Ropsten or Rinkeby, to avoid spending real money. You will also need to have Node.js and npm installed on your computer.

Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone.
Install the necessary dependencies using npm install.
Connect your RFID card reader and fob to your computer.
Create a new branch for your code using git branch.
Write code to integrate the RFID card reader and fob with the Svelte application.
Use Web3.js to send a transaction to the blockchain when a contactless transaction is detected.
Deploy the application to IPFS using Pinata or another IPFS hosting service.
Link your Unstoppable Domain to the IPFS hash of the application's build files.
Test the application by visiting your Unstoppable Domain in a web browser and using the RFID card reader and fob to trigger a contactless transaction.
